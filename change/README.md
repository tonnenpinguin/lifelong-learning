### 1. How do you figure out what the next thing is/what your evolution is?
All change happens a lot slower than we think.
Exercise:
Ask yourself questions without reaching for the answer.
You keep asking yourself the question without reaching for the answer.
For example: What is my purpose?
Let this work on you for a while and see what shows up.
-> Try to pull your evolution out of the material world and make it more of an idea first

Is this decision expansive or contractive to me?

Develop an intuition around the hell-yeahs. You're saying yes to something deep inside of you and by moving towards that you create a greater alignment between your authentic self and how you represent yourself.

### 2. How do you have the confidence to do it?

### 3. How do you know what to do in order to get it?

There's a whiteboard with the plan you set for yourself and there's another blank whiteboard, which represents the opportunities that the world brings to you.
