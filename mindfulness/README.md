When you know something absolutely you stop paying attention to it.

If you think you definitely can't change anything you won't do anything about it.
If you leave yourself open to "who knows, maybe I can change it" you might give it a try.

### Attention to symptom variability

If you get a diagnosis, most people assume things will stay the same or get worse.
If we pay attention on if the symptoms are better and why, we have a way of controlling it.

Set a timer to a random time. When it goes off ask yourself
"Are my symptoms better or worse and why?"

This can start the following:

- You start a process where you feel in control
- Noticing that things are a little better you experience moments of relieve
- By asking yourself why you engage in a mindfull search. Studies show that this alone is good for your health
- If you believe or look for a cure you are more likely to find one

### Mindfulness

A simple exercise: "Notice three new things about something that you know"

50:20 "The value of outcomes is in our heads. The outcome is nothing. The way you understand it will determine your emotional response to it. The more mindful you are the more ways you can look at it - the more choices you have"

Believe can drive better outcomes.

- Take on the assumption that everything is uncertain
- Especially when stressed we make predictions about things that can't be predicted and we're oblivious to the fact that we're of their experience of that.

Instead of worrying about an uncertain outcome make a plan on how you'll deal with it.
-> Worrying about it will make you less able to deal with it.

> If we treat ourselves as we are we will remain that way. If we treat ourselves as we can be then we'll become as we can be

### Remission

A person gets back from hospital and after having cancer is told it's gone - therefore they're in remission.
If I go to the same hospital and do the same test I'm told I don't have cancer.
If you have a cold and it's gone you wouldn't say you were in remission. If you get a cold again you would treat it as a different cold.
Seeing yourself as "in remission" rather than as cured makes you wait for the cancer to return.
Stress has a very big influence on developing diseases.

1:27:00 Draw your emotions with your non dominant hands.
It's not about what you're drawing - the act of drawing opens your "feelings channels". If you're not an artist this doesn't trigger the intellectual, but the emotional side of your brain.

When you feel anxiety ask yourself: Is this a real threat, or not?
If it's not a real threat this is an unfelt feeling.
The more unfealt feelings you have, the more debilitating the anxiety becomes if there's no actual threat.
